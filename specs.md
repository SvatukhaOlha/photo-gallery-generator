# here's your project you can code next. 
## im writing so you can copy this info.

let's build your favorite app instagram, with a twist.
This app will generate profiles with just a single word.

for example, if the user types "dogs", our app will create an instagram profile with dog pictures.

# Part 1
we need to build the UI of an instagram profile.

so visit https://instagram.com/olhasvatukha in a web browser and build the page with HTML and CSS first this time. 

Just build the main sections.

Don't worry about the buttons, icons, follower / following and etc. Just create some empty sections for now with the right spacing.

The important part is the "posts" section of the page (rows of 3 images). try to create these posts with javascript and not HTML, because later we will use JSON for this.

Do this first with test array with image URLS like
const testImages = [
   'https://image-url.com',
]

Once you are done with the UI, send me a link, let me check.

# Part 2
we will use this API to get free images 
https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/

You can send a string to this API and it works like a search.

So basically, the user will enter an input, we will store this input in a variable and send it to the API as a parameter

This API "function" will then return an array of image URLs we can load into our page.

This will be similar to your last project, but the main difference being when we call "fetch" (it won't be until the user takes action)

Remember, focus on building the UI first, and if you are stuck for more than 30 mins ask for my help. 

There is no reason to waste time.
